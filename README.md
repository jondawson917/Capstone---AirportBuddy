The goal of Airport Buddy is to provide a trip management tool for group to plan their trip to the airport. 
Travelers can manage create, edit, and remove trip-info while viewing security wait times and commute-time to the airport.

This requires two API keys from the following:

TSA WAIT TIMES API - https://www.tsawaittimes.com/api (7 DAY EXPIRATION)

BING MAPS API - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/choose-your-bing-maps-api (NO EXPIRATION)
